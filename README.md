**Author:** _\<Paloma Leiton\>_

**Due date:** _\<3/11/16>_

## Description

_\ In turtlestar.py a program must be made to ask the use for a side and length input and a star must be drawn from it. In boolean.py one must explain what the outcome of each statement would be. In repeated_sqrt.py one had to explain what the program was doing and explain why it comes back to 1 and not 2.  \>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to write a code for the turtle to draw stars depending on the numbers the user inputs. I also gained a better understanding on the difference between or, and, True, and False in program code. Lastly, I learned how to fix rounding errors. \>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
